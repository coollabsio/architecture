# Table

## Overview

Use Shadcn-Svelte Table/Data Table as base. Compact rows, neutral borders, hover row background, sticky/scroll overflow where needed. Actions go right; statuses use Badge/Status Indicator.

## Colors

Use neutral light-mode surfaces and Coolify dark-mode `coolgray` surfaces. Accent/focus colors follow purple in light mode and yellow in dark mode.

## Typography

Use compact `text-sm` body text. Titles, where present, use bold Coolify heading style.

## Layout

Use Shadcn-Svelte Table/Data Table as base. Compact rows, neutral borders, hover row background, sticky/scroll overflow where needed. Actions go right; statuses use Badge/Status Indicator.

## Elevation & Depth

Use borders and subtle shadows only where the component is an overlay. Avoid heavy shadows and gradients.

## Shapes

Use `rounded-sm`.

## Components

Compose existing V2 components where needed: Button, Badge, Input, Spinner, and links.

## Do's and Don'ts

Do use horizontal overflow on small screens. Do keep rows dense. Don't use large card-like rows for normal tables.

## Implementation Notes

Prefer the closest Shadcn-Svelte primitive and extend locally for Coolify density/colors.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Uses compact spacing.
- [ ] Works in light and dark mode.
- [ ] Uses existing V2 primitives where possible.
- [ ] Avoids legacy design references.

## Claude Improvement Notes

Future variants can be added after real product screens expose more states.

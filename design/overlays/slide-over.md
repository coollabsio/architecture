# Slide-over Sheet

## Overview

Use Shadcn-Svelte Sheet as base. Right side panel, neutral/coolgray border, title/description, close button, scrollable body, footer actions.

## Colors

Use neutral light-mode surfaces and Coolify dark-mode `coolgray` surfaces. Accent/focus colors follow purple in light mode and yellow in dark mode.

## Typography

Use compact `text-sm` body text. Titles, where present, use bold Coolify heading style.

## Layout

Use Shadcn-Svelte Sheet as base. Right side panel, neutral/coolgray border, title/description, close button, scrollable body, footer actions.

## Elevation & Depth

Use borders and subtle shadows only where the component is an overlay. Avoid heavy shadows and gradients.

## Shapes

Use `rounded-sm`.

## Components

Compose existing V2 components where needed: Button, Badge, Input, Spinner, and links.

## Do's and Don'ts

Do use for secondary context. Don't replace destructive confirmation or full-page workflows.

## Implementation Notes

Prefer the closest Shadcn-Svelte primitive and extend locally for Coolify density/colors.

## Review Checklist

- [ ] Uses compact spacing.
- [ ] Works in light and dark mode.
- [ ] Uses existing V2 primitives where possible.
- [ ] Avoids legacy design references.

## Claude Improvement Notes

Future variants can be added after real product screens expose more states.
